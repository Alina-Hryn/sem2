# Ruby Lexer
## Task
Implement lexer for selected programming language. Store tokens in a special table. Display structured lexical information after processing. Make sure to detect and indicate lexical errors in the input. To accomplish this a specialized error �token� could be introduced.
Language for my work - RUBY.
